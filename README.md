1. Individual Assignment 1

    Individual Assignment 1 focuses on using data visualization to move from population-level evidence to a targeted, actionable mental health intervention. In this project, I explored depression as a public health     issue, motivated by its growing relevance in Singapore. Using multiple datasets, I constructed three progressive visualizations: a macro-level plot to identify demographic groups most at risk, a micro-level         analysis to examine key factors associated with depression among teenagers, and an actionable plot to identify Singapore estates where interventions could be most effectively deployed. Together, these 
    visualizations aim to support evidence-based policy design by highlighting who is most affected, why the issue persists, and where targeted resources should be prioritised.
